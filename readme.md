## Overview

**Project Title**: Dialogue Adventure (Sprint 2 Test)

**Project Description**: A character that you can move around and talk to the hooded NPC to choose your medieval weapon. 

**Project Goals**: To learn how to use unity better and make a character, a world, an NPC, as well as creating dialogue between characters.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. All that needs to be done is to press the play button at the top of the screen (if using the program)
2. If using the game itself it will start playing on its own
3.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Once program is opened or pressed play button, you can start moving around with WASD
2. If you move on to the hooded character a fire symbol will appear, press E
3. Some dialogue will show up, press W or S to move up and down the list of dialogue to make decision, press R on the decision you want to make

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* If you want to see the code and the programming behind it, you will need unity to do so. 
* Other than that, if you just want to play the game it should be pretty straight click on the shortcut and play the game.

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I want to make collision in the characters and walls.
